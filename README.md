Kino
------------------------
Building a Web service is one of the ways to implement a component, accessible over the network. But what if the functionality we would like to expose is too small for a stand-alone service?  Although, WS might still be a proper design choice, let's try something else...

**Kino** is an *[Actor] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)-like* framework for implementing and hosting components, accessible over the network. In other words, **kino** allows to build *networks* of components. It is a foundation for your applications based on Microservices architecture, but can be small enough to be used just within one process.

Fault-tolerance and load scale-out by redundant deployment of actors, possibility to broadcast messages â€“ everything without additional infrastructure dependencies. Rendezvous service provides actors auto-discovery and reduces amount of required configuration.

Platform requirements: Windows with .NET 4.6+.
