                    ROUTER URI                              <= VERSIONING: new frames come on top
                    ROUTER ID                               Message routing

                    Callback Message Partition              <= VERSIONING: new frames come on top
                    Callback Version
                    Callback Message ID                     Callbacks

----------------
    n-20                Callback Frames Divisor                 Number of parts/frames per each Callback entry
    n-19                Message Routing Frames Divisor          Number of parts/frames per each Routing entry
----------------
n-18                Message Partition                       Messsage Partion
n-17                Receiver Node ID                        MessageRouter Socket Identity to which the message should be routed
----------------
Are "Message Routing Entries Count" and "Message Hops" not the same?
Should just always keep Hops and set "Routing Start Frame Offset" to -1 if no routing recorded?


    n-16                Message Hops                            Number of times a Message was sent away to another node
    n-15				Message Routing Entries Count           Number of message route entries
                                                                Own Socket Identities and URIs added by every MessageRouter, forwarding the message:
                                                                Frames: 1 - URI, 
                                                                        2 - socket ID
    n-14				Routing Start Frame Offset              Offset of the first message route frame
----------------
n-13                TraceOptions                            Type of tracing to record for the message
n-12				Version							        Message Version
n-11			    Message ID						        Message Identifier
n-10				Receiver ID						        Socket Identity of the receiver of the message. Empty frame, for the non-specific receiver
n-9					Distribution pattern			        One of the following distribution patterns {Unicast, Broadcast}
n-8					Correlation ID					        Unique identifier, copied onto all messages, spawned within the same flow, from the initial one
----------------
    n-7                 Callback Entries Count                  Number of callback entries:
                                                                Frames: 1 - Callback Message Identifier, 
                                                                        2 - Callback Version,
                                                                        3 - Partition
    n-6                 Callback Start Frame Offset             Offset of the first callback messages frames
----------------
n-5					Callback Receiver ID			        Value from this field will be copied to Receiver Identity when 
                                                                Message Identifier becomes equal to Callback Message Identifier
n-4					TTL								        Message Time-to-Live in msec.
n-3                 Wire Format Version                     Version of the message wire format
n-2					[0]                                     Empty frame
n-1					Body							        Message content

ActorHost is responsible for:
- setting of Receiver ID to the value of Callback Receiver ID, when for the current message 
    Message ID == Callback Message ID and Version == Callback Version
- propagation of Correlation ID from incoming messages to all outgoing messages

Message handler is selected based on the following algorithm:
if 
	ReceiverIdentifier is set, 
then
	Version && Receiver ID
else
	Version && Message ID
